VERSION CONTROL
Will be using git
Version control with Scott Chacon is a good resource 
or
git-scm.com

git is a way of saving you work at different points in your project
can also use git to push your code to online repositories (like github, bitbucket) or production hosting services like heroku
online repositories allow you to also share your code with other developers 

- initialize a git repository for the application (make sure you are in the main application directory)
